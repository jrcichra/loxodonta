# Loxodonta
A social media platform for privacy-focused mammals

## Status
+ Still in early development - not ready for alpha use yet
+ Get up and running with `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d` and visit http://localhost:3000

## Purpose/Goals
+ Self-hosted social media ( maybe IPFS support at some point?)
+ Easier to set up than Mastodon
+ Keep it simple

## Tech Stack
+ Vue / Nuxt.js (Frontend)
+ GraphQL (API)
+ MariaDB (ascii / blob links)
+ Minio (s3-like blob storage)
+ Node.js (backend)
+ Docker (easy deployments)
